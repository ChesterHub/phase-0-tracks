<label>Full name:</label>
	- This is the actual label "Full Name"
<input type="text" name="fullname">
	- type="text" This designates the characters as texts
	- name="fullname" This is the name of the textbox
<input type="email" name="email">
	- type="email" This designates the characters as an email URL.
	- name="email" This is the name of the textbox
<input type="password" name="password">
	- The type="password"  I am assuming this makes the string that we enter invisible.
<input type="text" name="adv-name" placeholder="Name this adventure">
	placeholder="Name this adventure" This gives the textbox an instructional text that is overwritten once we put in a string.
<select name="bike">
        <option value="road">Road</option>
        <option value="road">Mountain</option>
        <option value="road">Cyclocross</option>
      </select>
      The select function makes a combobox.
      I think the value="road" is the attribute it will hold when we choose a selection? I'm not too sure about this one.
      I know that the word between >< is just the text.
<input type="date" name="date">
	type="date" This makes a textbox with the ability to input dates.
<div>
      <input type="checkbox" name="cb-agree" value="agree">
      I am prepared to lead this adventure.
   </div>
   input type="checkbox"  This creates the checkbox
   value="agree" We're still not sure what value means but it it might mean the value it holds after your selection?
  <button type="submit">Save this adventure</button>
  	type="submit" creates a button that is an action.
