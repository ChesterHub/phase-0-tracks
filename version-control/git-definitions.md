# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control means to have a system where all iterations of a version project can be saved. New code can be experimented on and reviewed before ultimately merge with the main project. This not only allows us to revert back to previous iterations if a problem comes along in our code, but it also gives everyone the ability to also work on the project without changing original code.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a section of code that is split off from the master code. This code won't by added to the master unless we give permission to do so. This allows us to work on a project without altering any previous code, until we decide that the branch is ready to be merged.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is saving a file that we added or worked on. A good git message would be saying anything that shows the additions or changes we made to our code. Also keeping it short and sweet like "Add a bow tie to sebastion the octopus"
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is something that occurs when we try to merge a branch to the main code, but ther is an error in the code that prevents that action.
