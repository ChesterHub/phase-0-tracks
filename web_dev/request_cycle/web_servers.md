Philosophies of the Linux System
- Make each program do one thing well.
- Connect all programs to work together through a web.
- Design software that can be tested soon. Don't be afraid to throw away inefficient parts.
- Use all tools to help in programming. You can figure out the harder way later.

Advantages of using a VPS
-You should use VPS when your shared hosting plan becomes too slow. If your website is getting too much traffic, it is time to switch to something more reliable.
-When you want freedom in designing everything. This includes security, maintenance, and new software. Shared hosting may not allow this.
-Bang for your buck. Sacrificing some performance, VPS is cheaper than a dedicated server.
